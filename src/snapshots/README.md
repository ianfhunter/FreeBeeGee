# Snapshots

These are the snapshots shipped with FreeBeeGee.

Please only add minified / optimized images here. We don't want to waste time to gulp-image them on each build and it also saves space in the git repo.

The `_` directory contains a special *system* snapshot. It will be extracted to each room first, providing system-wide default assets.
